            <h1>About Tree</h1>
            <p>Towering sentinels of the natural world, trees are vital to the health of our planet. Through photosynthesis, they act as nature's lungs, converting carbon dioxide into life-giving oxygen. Their extensive root systems anchor the soil, preventing erosion, and their leaves provide cooling shade and habitat for countless creatures. From the towering redwoods to the humble apple tree, these living giants offer us a wealth of resources, from food and building materials to medicine. Protecting these irreplaceable organisms is essential for our own survival and the well-being of the planet.</p>
